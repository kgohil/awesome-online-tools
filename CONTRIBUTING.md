# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Awesome Online Tools!

## Guidelines

- Search existing entries before adding new ones to avoid duplicates
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion
- Use the following format: `- [Tool Name](link) - Description.`
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional
- Check your spelling and grammar
- Make sure your text editor removes trailing whitespace
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome
- Update the Table of Contents if adding new categories

## Quality Standards

### Tool Requirements
- **Web-based**: The tool should be accessible via web browser without installation
- **Privacy-focused**: Preference for tools that process data client-side
- **Actively maintained**: Tools should be updated within the last 2 years
- **Useful for development/productivity**: Must serve developers, designers, or content creators
- **Free or freemium**: Free tools preferred, but high-quality paid tools acceptable if noted
- **No self-promotion**: Wait at least 30 days after creating a tool before submitting it

### Description Guidelines
- Start with capital letter and end with period
- Be descriptive but concise (ideally under 100 characters)
- Focus on functionality, not opinions or marketing language
- No subjective terms like "best", "amazing", "awesome"
- Mention key features that differentiate the tool

**Good Examples:**
```markdown
- [JSON Formatter & Validator](https://www.tools-online.app/tools/json) - Validates, formats, and beautifies JSON data with tree view.
- [Python Editor](https://www.tools-online.app/tools/python) - Online Python editor with real-time execution and standard library support.
```

**Bad Examples:**
```markdown
- [Amazing Tool](https://example.com) - The best tool ever! You'll love it.
- [JSON Formatter](https://example.com) - json formatter
- [My Super Tool](https://example.com) - Revolutionary new way to format code (self-promotion)
```

### Link Requirements
- Must be working and accessible
- Should be the main/canonical URL
- No affiliate links or referral codes
- No URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)
